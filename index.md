BrickStore is a BrickLink offline management tool. It is **multi-platform** (Windows, macOS and
Linux as well as iOS and Android), **multilingual** (currently English, German, Spanish, Swedish
and French), **fast** and **stable**.

Some things you can do with BrickStore much more efficiently than with any web based interface:

* Browse and search the BrickLink catalog using a live, as-you-type filter. It is using all the
  cores in your machine to be as fast as possible.
* Easily create XML files for Mass-**Upload** and Mass-**Update** either by parting out sets or by
  adding individual parts (or both).
* Download and view any order by order number.
* Download and view your whole store inventory. An easy way to use this for repricing, is to use the
  BrickLink Mass-Upload functionality.
* Price your items based on the latest price guide information.
* Create XML data for the BrickLink inventory upload.
* If you load files which contain items with obsolete item ids you can fix them using the BrickLink
  catalog change-log.
* Calculate differences between two documents: you can easily check, if it is possible to build a
  set given your current inventory.
* Unlimited undo/redo support.
* Customized printing via JavaScript based page templates.
